###you've seen my resume. this is a deeper dive into the kind of work I've done and intend to do.


####Designer from upstate ny with a hankering for user experience and an honest appreciation of design

The bulk of my professional experience has been as an in-house graphic designer. I learned type, color, grids, gestalt, print and importantly, clients. 

Early 2013, I left that job and took on what I had been doing on the side for years: web design. 

[Photography](http://www.flickr.com/wesleymiles) and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2638610-wes?shelf=wes-favorites) can tell more than words about a person.


I want to help an organization with their design and ux needs in a full time committed way



####toolbox
 - **technology:** grid systems, web typography, responsive design, html, css, cms, markdown, emmet, sass
 - **methods:** lean workflow, gtd, wireframes, flow diagrams, content inventories, taxonomies, mockups
- **applications:** adobe ps & ai, st, transit, basecamp, google docs

these are the tools in my toolbox currently. i'm very open to try out a new hammer or use a better way to sharpen my old knives.

#Brady People ID

This is a non-web usability story set in my first job out of college as a graphic designer. How I upgraded a proof form to increase efficiency of our tiny design team. 

Brady produced security products and printed customer artwork on them. Among standard design duties, I lead the continual development of our proof form. One was attached to every order a designer did. Each product had it's own proof template. We recreated logos, measured to the pixel and sometimes spent hours in one order; we knew the forms well.

This form was equally important to two user groups. The production team needed it to confirm the print was correct. And the customer used it as a final-sign-off for their order. Every change to the document needed to please both parties. 


##challenge

###more work, less workers
During the recession, the graphics department downsized workers and increased orders, the same way it happened with many other companies. We went from 20 orders a day to 50. From 5 graphic designers to 2. Those of us remaining were instructed to innovate for efficiency.

###unhappy customers
Before I worked there, proofs were faxed to customers. Some time later, Brady upgraded to PDF proofs via email. The document displayed a swatch of print, specifications the print shop needed and a rough idea of a final print.

The roughness occasionally caused unhappy customers. In the image below, you can't tell if the text will be facing inwards or out, and you can't tell how far up the lanyard the imprint will be (without measuring). This left some suprised end users when they recieved their final product. Printers were blamed and customer service took the job of apologizing.
  
###new printing facility
The company bought a production facility in China, in addition to the one they had stateside, in 2007. That print shop wasn't two cubes down from graphics anymore, so more specifications were needed on the proofs. With the language barrier and time difference, we needed to be super clear to minimize the risk of mistake. That meant, the proofs now had 3 parties to please; local production, overseas production and customers.



##process

###apply web knowledge to work
During this time, I was freelancing on the side and inhaling everything on usability I could. It made complete sense to use the principals in 'Don't make me think' at work. The design had two main user types. For the customers, I designed for an easy scan. The would not check every detail. They, generally, wanted the colors and print to look right in the 3d sample image. For producion, I used the "conventions are your friend" axium. They was familiar to the way the job ticket looked, so I designed the proof to match that layout. It would be a simpler side-by-side check.

###talk with customers
To understand how the customer was using these proofs, we chose three high ordering ones to discuss their thoughts of trial proofs. I promoted candidness and 'clear reasons why' in their responses. Having received plenty of design feedback from web projects, I understood how important it is to ask for specific feedback. Bad feedback is subjective. Good feedback gets to the core of why they want this font less bold.

###testing
The new factory was acquired and the printers needed a proof they would understand, fast. Orders were coming in. I designed different versions and tested them with real jobs. China was able to test our proofs thoroughly, as they received roughly 20 proofs per day. One version had all of the information, but it was too long (two pages total). Another version had different layouts for domestic and overseas production, but that became confusing because some customers received two different looking proofs. 

Ultimately, I was part of a small team open to change. We didn't have to wait for approval to impliment. The platform we were testing on was perfect for incremental changes. And the high numbers we were working with meant we would hear feedback fast. A perfect environment for tiny tests. As we promoted rock solid communication, the end users and producers let us know how things worked and what could be better.


##solution
Here are the iterations with the final one still used today at the end. We ended up with one sheet, decreased the size of the image and a standardized the angle of the lanyard layout. 


##results
The amount of calls we got about products being different than the proof went way down. We decided on one proof for both production facilities, and customers avoided the confusion of keeping them separate. The proof set-up time efficiancy increased because the lanyard layout was standardized. One click (an Illustrator action) could be used to transform straight repeated art into a right and left sided lanyard layout. 


#Adlife Office


Adlife Office is the internal start-up of Adlife, a 35 year old ad agency. They opened summer 2013, about a month before I joined. 

I worked with clients as a web consultant. Walking non-web folks through the process of getting their site online. We offered custom, affordable static sites. Responsive and SEO ready.

The bigger takeaway was working within a young start-up, building processes, making it up as we went, trying then failing, then trying a different way.


##challenge

####cater to variety
Our tagline was, a walk-in ad agency. Therefore, unsurprisingly, our clientele varied a lot. Folks heard that we offer print and web services and came in asking everything. Some with manila folders of strategy in hand, some lacking the finer details of a business plan, some having no knowledge of a website's role, some interested in a project hugely out of their budget.

####meetings
The next step was a consultation. This was the crux of our business; offering folks a chance to talk face-to-face about their website. We were an answer to those jaded from the DIY web services of today. One-by-one, we'd structure a strategy, narrow the content scope, find the website's reason for being and sell. Like other early stage companies, there was no process to follow. It was bushwacking.
 

####money & contracts
Everyone is a salesperson they say. When you gather your friends to go to the restaurant you want to go to, when you plan a vacation; it's all sales. I didn't find anecdotes like these helpful. 

I knew about websites and I could convey that, but the sales end was new to me. There were no other web salespeople in-house and I felt out of my comfort zone. I had some experience selling my design services over the years, but it wasn't as formal. Here, there was a conference table, contracts, dotted lines, the whole bit. 


##process
####classic 'learn as you go' setting
I don't want to say that every meeting was cumulatively better, but working with many different personality types was **helpful**. Not only my confidence, but for creating a better conversion roadmap. I'd take notes on how the meeting was going during the meeting and write down what to bring to the table next time. 

####do
My uncomfortableness was still present. Something was working though. After dozens and dozens of meetings, conversions were going up. Numbers became people. People whose businesses I cared about. As projects progressed I focused on helping people with their dreams and forgot about being a saleman.


##solution
####tiny solutions
There were places in the Adlife Office boat that leaked. Every hole filled in felt like a win for everyone. As much we all wanted to scrap everything, close down for a week and start over; plugging away here and there was working. They added up. We started to figure out when to get the client to sign, how to wrap up a meeting, answers to common questions, what info people would want in a printed takeaway, why people seemed confused when they first walked in.

####while informing clients, inform colleagues
I was the web department, and through osmoses, the team learned the jargon and web design process. Constantly communicating about little things and implementing as soon as possible was key. As I taught them web, they critiqued my meetings. Their feedback was insanely helpful to me. 

I tried to promote a culture of sharing as much as I could. I was the quiet evangelist, preaching google docs and shared calendars.


##results


####more sound process
After six months, the process has been tuned and tweaked a lot and those in the office feel more confident when someone comes in talking about the web. The changes that have worked include; 

 - **quick reference for staff or clients:** a post card explaining our web services. helpful for the staff and as a giveaway to clients
 - **less time invested in tire-kickers:** quickly vetting potential clients before wasting a consultation
 - **more focused meetings:** scheduling meetings with a start and end time 


One example of a process upgrade was convincing more clients to think about content first. This idea is well known in our [industry](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1598). First decide what the site will say, then design and develop around that. But, we often want to jump to the fun part; pictures, fonts, colors!

The solution was educating clients better about content. After failed attempts at explaining, I tried bringing a blank content outline to the first meeting; displaying emptiness like an assignment. It emphasized the difference between what I will do and what they will do. The second line of defense, if folks were slow to write content, was to show the dashingly designed site, blank, dying for content.

People understood with the visuals. It bolstered using voice to portray my points. I was amazed how well that worked. My tiny changes effected the bottom line.

####happy clients
The mindset adjustment from sales numbers to people was important for me. It removed weight. I am proud to have helped with many Rhode Island small businesses and entrepreneurs.

#A Redesign
####School of Groove
This is a detailed account of a website redesign project I found through twitter.

The School of Grove (SoG) is a non-profit, private music school tht started in 2007. They have a nice facility, covered inside and out with custom murals, in popular Inman Square, Cambridge, MA. They reached a level where there was staff handling their social media and their once suitable website was falling behind on design trends and features.


##challenge
####team change
We were a duo, consisting of a php developer and myself. We were states away so face-to-face meetings were difficult. Communication was done through email, video chats and cloud sharing. This was a side project for both of us. Mid-way through, my developer got a new position. We agreed that he would no longer take on his roles and that I would fullfill the remaining development.

The SoG team was local to me and consisted of the CEO, Marketing Manager, School Administrator and mural/logo designer. Everyone was cc'ed on emails and things often got into design-by-committee situations. Each person had their own vision.


####rebrand
The site was originally built using a custom theme on WordPress and it contained a couple of years of content. We decided this was a good time to reorganize the site; what legacy data should remain, what sections should be emphasized, what the call-to-actions should be, ect. These questions prompt underlying questions about the business and it's identity. It was a perfect time to readdress who SoG was and who their target was.


##process

####collaboration
We sussed through the old content using spreadsheets for management. [See the gdoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Atr-54ndALYDdFdQRnJxQXBHeHl0MG5BcXJ3U2pWWnc&usp=docslist_api#gid=0) (the versions of iterations are on tabs at the bottom). Working from shared documents allowed SoG move through the content auditing process without being distracted by the old site, and without emails. 

####phases
My developer and I processed the needs and brainstormed, starting with the initial proposal spec, which encompassed the redesign plan. There were three main phases; design, front-end, back-end, two parts per phase. 

Here are some screenshots from the design phase;

spec / wireframes / hand drawings / styleguide / user flow image


##solution

####frameworks
We built on a new custom theme WordPress using twitter bootstrap. It was a familiar framework for us and thus, lead to fast prototyping.

####single point of contact
This initial problem was my fault. It could have been avoided had we structured the system clearly from the outset: one point of contact for each party. This solution's benefits were two-fold; it saved the developer from being bogged down by emails and it cured design by committee. Each team agreed, then confided in their contact person, then communicated.

####iterative
Once the main wireframes and atmosphere were approved, the biggest launch we had, everything else was pushed out one-by-one. The biggest positive to the elemental approach was that it allowed us to hear feedback sooner. Each element had focus when implimented. Bugs wouldn't be hidden by distraction. 

Working in small sprints was fitting for the last leg of development. I would spend time getting the hang of a new system, deploy it, then move to the next. 

Rough iterations after the main site launch;

5. pricing table
5. blog
5. email signup form
6. instructors archive
7. quick search on homepage
8. scheduling integration
9. payment integration
 

##results
The client ended up with a site that better reflected their identity. The murals inside matched the site, prospective students can now schedule lessons, pay and check teachers availability online. 

I also learned loads on management and development.
